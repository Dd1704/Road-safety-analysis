# Road-safety-analysis
## Evaluate the frequency and severity of road accidents by location, time of day, and day of the week to identify high-risk areas and timeframes.
### This project embarks on a comprehensive analysis of road accident data to unveil actionable insights crucial for bolstering road safety measures and minimizing accident occurrences. The dataset encompasses pivotal details such as accident dates, times, locations, severity levels, weather conditions, road types, casualties, and vehicle involvement. Through meticulous data scrutiny and visualization techniques, the primary aim is to discern underlying patterns, emerging trends, and pivotal factors contributing to road accidents. The ultimate objective is to furnish evidence-based recommendations geared towards fostering informed decision-making among policymakers and pertinent stakeholders.
#### Tools used are Microsoft Excel, Power Query Bi, SQL, and Data Visualisation tools including charts and pivot tables, the dataset used was cleansed, prepared, and analyzed using QDA ( qualitative data analysis). Moreover prepared a predictive model based on the given dataset to determine ways to reduce the occurrence of accidents and introduce safety measures to curb them

This Dataset analyses three main questions.

ARE THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES CHANGING DEPENDING ON ROAD STRUCTURE?
HOW SEVERE CASUALTIES WERE TO HUMAN FATALITY?
CORRELATION BETWEEN WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES?
